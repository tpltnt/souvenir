*what?*: A script to try to battle linkrot/memory holes/disappearing internet sources

*why?*: Research is (in part) about credible sources. Today you might find a certain piece of
      information only on the internet and not on dead tree anymore. Think for example about
      a blogpost when you are a social scientist. Are there any good data sources about
      current events? If so, are they enough? Many fear using the internet since it is a
      pretty volatile medium. Having a book means having the same unchanged source to work
      with, almost independently of time and place. That is what researchers want.
      This script is an attempt to make saving webpages more credible by throwing in the magic
      of checksums. This way a researcher can always present a source as s/he saw it, so
      other can draw their own conclusions.

*how?*:

- get current snapshot
- archive material
- provide some context information
- provide checksums for tamper resistance
